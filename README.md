# Efficient-Domain-Specific-Fine-Tuning-of-Open-Source-Llama-3-LLM
 Llama3-Finetune-PoC demonstrates efficient fine-tuning of the Llama 3 model on domain-specific datasets using PEFT techniques like LoRA and QLoRA. It optimizes resource usage with free Kaggle notebooks (2 T4 GPUs) and scales to cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker or on-premises setups.

# OpenLLM-Llama3-Domain-Finetune  
**Efficient Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning of Open-Source Llama 3 LLM using PEFT Techniques**  

## Overview  
**OpenLLM-Llama3-Domain-Finetune** is a modular, resource-efficient framework for fine-tuning the open-source Llama 3 large language model (LLM) on a domain-specific dataset. It employs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like **LoRA** and **QLoRA** to enable lightweight, high-performance customization.  

This project is ideal for both **on-premises deployments** and **cloud environments**, offering the flexibility to fine-tune models on local hardware or scale to advanced GPUs on platforms like AWS SageMaker. The workflow supports advanced customization to adapt Llama 3 to specific use cases, providing a robust solution for domain adaptation in resource-constrained and scalable setups.  

The process addresses memory and runtime challenges by splitting the workflow into three modular stages, ensuring stability and flexibility for real-time fine-tuning, merging, and inference tasks.

## Key Features  
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Optimize resources by training only a small subset of parameters using LoRA/QLoRA.  
- **On-Premises and Cloud Compatibility**: Fine-tune models locally on GPUs like T4 or scale to powerful cloud-based GPUs like A100 or A10 on AWS SageMaker.  
- **Customizable Workflow**: Modular design allows for tailored adaptations to various datasets and specific deployment requirements.  
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Seamlessly upload fine-tuned adapters and final models for sharing and deployment.  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Achieve high-quality results even on free platforms like Kaggle notebooks.

## Workflow  

### **1. Fine-Tuning PEFT Adapters**  
Fine-tune the Llama 3 model on a domain-specific dataset with LoRA/QLoRA, focusing only on essential parameters. The adapters are then uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub for further use.  

### **2. Merging Adapters with Base Model**  
Combine the fine-tuned adapters with the base Llama 3 model to create a fully fine-tuned model. This step ensures that the model is ready for deployment and uploaded as a complete package.  

### **3. Inference and Validation**  
Use the final fine-tuned model for domain-specific inference. Evaluate its performance using validation datasets and custom metrics tailored to your use case.

## Use Cases  
- Fine-tuning open-source LLMs for **on-premises** systems with limited computational resources.  
- Adapting LLMs for **cloud-based workflows** that require high scalability and performance.  
- Customizing Llama 3 for **specific domains**, such as healthcare, finance, or legal, with minimal effort.
